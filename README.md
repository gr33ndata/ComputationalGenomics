# Computational Genomics

Computational Genomics (often referred to as Computational Genetics) refers to the use of computational and statistical analysis to decipher biology from genome sequences and related data, including both DNA and RNA sequence. If you ignore the biological terminology, there are lots of shared knowledge between it and Computer Science. 

Personally, my backgroud is in Computer Science, with zero biological knowlege. Thus, I am currently reading a book about Computational Genomics, and to keep what I read in mind, I will apply it on `SARS-COV-2` (the new Corona virus). The virus's genome is stored in FASTA format in the `/fasta` folder.

## Project Structure

I will create a notebook per chapter (or topic).

- [Chapter 1 - Sequence Statistics](https://github.com/gr33ndata/ComputationalGenomics/blob/master/Chapter%201%20-%20Sequence%20Statistics%20.ipynb)
  - Read the genome data
  - Analyze its characher frequency (aka its nucleotide)
- [Chapter 2 - Gene Finding](https://github.com/gr33ndata/ComputationalGenomics/blob/master/Chapter%202%20-%20Gene%20Finding.ipynb)
  - Find Open Reading Frames (ORFs)
  - Evaluate how plausable an ORF is actually a gene 

I will use Markdown text as much as I can to explain what I am doing.



## About the Book
The book I am learning from at the moment is called [Introduction to Computational Genomics](https://amzn.to/2V4reIh) by Nello Cristianini
