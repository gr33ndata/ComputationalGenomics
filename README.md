# Computational Genomics

I am currently reading a book about Computational Genomics.
To keep what I read in mind, I will apply it on SARS-COV-2.

# Project Structure

I will create a notebook per chapter (or topic).
I will use Markdown text as much as I can to explain what I am doing.

## About the Book
The book is called Introduction to Computational Genomics by Nello Cristianini
